## Notebook Tutorials
Jupyter Notebook tutorials are available [here](https://github.com/elissasoroj/shadie/tree/main/shadie/notebooks). There is a detailed notebook for each 'step' of using `shadie` and an example full workflow. 

You must have Jupyter Notebooks and `shadie` installed locally to use these notebooks. You must also install SLiM3 to access all the functionality in the notebooks.
